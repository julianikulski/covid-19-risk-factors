# Identifying COVID-19 studies dealing with risk factors
Coronavirus is a serious public health threat to countries worldwide and rapid action must be taken to avoid the collapse of health care systems. There are numerous studies released every day containing information on the risk factors, transmission, incubation, diagnostics, potential vaccines and therapeutics, to just name a few of the topics covered.

However, with the increasing number of research papers it is become more and more difficult for humans to combed through the sheer mass of information and find patterns in the findings. Therefore, AI is needed to speed up the process and generate valuable insights from these studies.
